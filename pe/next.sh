# To DO:
# Make a script that will find the last problem euler file
# then make the next

# So far, I have ls p* | grep [0-9]* | tail -1

# the problem is that it sorts 1, 10, 11, 2, 3, ...

# I'll need to first rename and re-git the p1-9/py files

# then after that, I should pull that file name's number,
# increment and then cp the template to the new number.
